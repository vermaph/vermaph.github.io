 **Graduate Analyst, Quantium Analytics - Hyderabad India**<br />
  *R, SQL, Excel, VBA*<br /><br />
Generated competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client, focusing on comprehensive car insurance. Insights enabled client to understand their competitiveness against other competitors. I mainly used Lasso Regression technique to identify the factors determining a competitor's premiums. The data used for the analysis was collected by scraping multiple competitors' website for a number of customer segments. Apart from working on the regular deliverables, I also improved the process by: 
  - Adding a layer of quality check to spot online premium discounts. For this I integrated EXCEL with the SQL tables. This simple idea tracked the premium for the same quote every week and if any competitor offered a new online discount, it would track it and made sure the analyst didn't miss it in the analysis.
