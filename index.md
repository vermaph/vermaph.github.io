### Hello - नमस्ते - Hola - 你好!! 

My name is Piyush Verma and I am a data analytics professional based out of Chicago USA. Currently I am a Lead Analyst in the fraud strategy team at Discover Financial Services. I am the first line of defense for Discover in stopping fraudulent applications to enter the system. I deep-dive into application data to discover fraud patterns and create targeted fraud rules. Recently, I was nominated for Discover President Award 2021 for my work on revamping the decisioning framework.

I have a Masters degree in Business Analytics from the [University of Cincinnati](http://business.uc.edu/), graduating in 2018. I completed courses on Statistics, Probability Modelling, Machine Learning, Process Simulation and Optimization among many others. I was successful in boosting my statistical knowledge, getting more hands-on with tools-techniques-algorithms and exposure to myriad of analytics practices. 

Before enrolling in my masters in 2017, I worked as a Data Analyst for a Sydney based management consulting firm called [Quantium Analytics](https://www.quantium.com/) from 2014 to 2017. I worked on generating competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client and supported a supermarket client in revamping their $500 million loyalty rewards program. This experience acted as the launch pad for my career into data science. I have worked in India, Australia and now building career in US. 

I have completed my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2014.
