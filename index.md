### Hello - नमस्ते - Hola - 你好!! 

As an experienced Data Scientist at Home Depot, I drive the development and deployment of advanced machine learning models to unlock strategic marketing insights and enhance the customer experience. Proficient in Python, SQL, R, Google Cloud, BigQuery, and Tableau, I deliver data-driven solutions that optimize business performance.

During my tenure as Lead Data Science Analyst at Discover Financial Services, I spearheaded the creation of a game-changing fraud decision framework, significantly improving fraud detection rates by 30% and reducing losses by $10 million in FY 2020. My exceptional contributions earned recognition within the esteemed fraud strategy team.

With an MS in Business Analytics from the esteemed [University of Cincinnati](https://business.uc.edu/) and a background in Materials Engineering from the renowned [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), I possess a strong foundation for solving complex business problems with data and analytics.

Previously, as a Data Analyst at Quantium Analytics, I gained valuable experience in generating competitive intelligence insights for an insurance client and revitalizing a $500 million loyalty rewards program for a supermarket client. Now, building my career in the US, I remain passionate about continuous learning and leveraging innovative technologies to make a positive impact in the world of data science.
