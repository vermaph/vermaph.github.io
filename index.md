### Hello - नमस्ते - Hola - 你好!! 

As a Senior Data Scientist at Home Depot, USA I oversee ML-driven marketing data science for the Pro business . I am in charge of production model development and end-to-end ML. Providing DS thought leadership, assisting the team's junior data scientists, supervising pro model building projects, and overseeing the work of offshore analysts are some of my broader responsibilities. 
These ML models allow the creation of audiences for multichannel Pro campaigns, as well as the creation and maintenance of personas, marketing funnels, and measurement setups. My role's goal is to consistently deliver results by increasing campaign engagement, iROAS and owning data products.

I have also worked for Discover Bank USA as a Lead Analyst for 3 years, where I used data to create a game-changing fraud decision framework, significantly improving first & thrid party combined fraud detection rates by 30% and by estimate saved around $10 Million for FY2021. Moreover, I upskilled my managers in data tools such as SQL, Tableau and created a fun learning environment. 

I have a MS in Data Science from [University of Cincinnati](https://business.uc.edu/) and a Bachelors in Materials Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I am also pursuing a part-time Executive MBA program to hone my leadership skills.
